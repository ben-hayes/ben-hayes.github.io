I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and Music at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk)'s [Centre for Digital Music](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/).
My research blends digital signal processing and deep learning for audio synthesis and processing.
I am particularly interested in differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) and how this methodology can help us incorporate signal processing knowledge into deep learning systems.
I am jointly supervised by [Dr Charalampos Saitis](https://comma-lab.github.io) and [Dr Gy√∂rgy Fazekas](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/fazekasgyorgy.html), and am very grateful to be funded by the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/).

Previously, I was a research scientist intern at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/) (Music Intelligence), [Sony CSL](https://cslmusicteam.sony.fr/) (Music Team), and [Bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) (Speech, Audio & Music Intelligence), and lead the music team at [Jukedeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jukedeck). I have also worked extensively as a music producer, and was a lecturer in Electronic & Produced Music at the [Guildhall School of Music & Drama](https://www.gsmd.ac.uk/study-with-guildhall/music/principal-study-and-departments/electronic-produced-music) in London.
