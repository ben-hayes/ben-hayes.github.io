I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and Music at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk)'s [Centre for Digital Music](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/).
My research currently focuses on differentiable digital signal processing for deep learning based control over audio synthesisers and effects.
I am particularly interested in how we might overcome the optimisation pathologies that currently limit this methodology.
My broader research interests include audio synthesis, symmetry, meta-learning, timbre perception, and cross-modal interactions.
I am jointly supervised by [Dr Charalampos Saitis](https://comma-lab.github.io) and [Dr Gy√∂rgy Fazekas](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/fazekasgyorgy.html), and am very grateful to be funded by the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/).

Previously, I was Music Lead at the award-winning AI-driven generative music startup [Jukedeck](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jukedeck/about/), and was a research intern with [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/)'s Speech, Audio & Music Intelligence (SAMI) team. I also [make music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/73A1Xo6NzkbRB2EIw3dm6R) and taught undergraduate Electronic and Produced music at the [Guildhall School of Music and Drama](https://www.gsmd.ac.uk/study-with-guildhall/music/principal-study-and-departments/electronic-produced-music).

I am particularly open to collaborations with musicians and artists looking to apply artificial intelligence to their work, engineers interested in building new musical tools, and researchers working on related topics.
