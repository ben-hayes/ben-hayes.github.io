### why are you reading this?

The chances are you and I currently, or are about to, spend some time together.
Maybe we work together, are living together, or have somehow ended up in each other's lives.
This probably means that at some point you will notice some differences in the way I do things.

This is because I am autistic.

These differences are not inherently bad.
Some cause me problems. Some I'm quite fond of.
In any case, understanding them can help the time we spend together be easier for both of us.
I've written this to help with that understanding.

<!-- Being autistic, the words that come out of my mouth don't always match what it is I'm trying to communicate.
By writing this down, I hope we can save some time, avoid confusion, and generally have a better experience together. -->

This page will give you [a little background](#a-little-background) on autism, explain [why I might not seem autistic](#but-you-dont-seem-autistic), and give you an idea of what you can do to make our experience together easier for both of us.
In particular, there's some info on how we can [communicate better](#communication), some of the [differences in the way my brain processes information](#executive-functioning-and-sensory-processing), and why some of my needs [might be different to yours](#the-bucket).
Clicking any point in these last three sections will reveal a short explanation, and where relevant an illustrative example from my life.

### tl;dr

* I am a normal human being. <span class="example">autism is not a problem: it is a difference in how I experience the world.</span>
* be direct. don't assume I've understood anything conveyed through tone, context, or body language.
* be tolerant of my communication style. <span class="example">I form connections through sharing information.</span>
* respect my personal space (I need lots). ask me before requiring my attention or energy.
* respect my need to control aspects of my environment.
* give me advance warning about changes in plan, especially when they require social contact.
* try not to interrupt me unnecessarily <span class="example">(but feel free to interrupt unwanted monologues).</span>
* be conscious that noise that I have no control over is distressing for me.
* by [masking](#but-you-dont-seem-autistic) I'm working hard to make you comfortable. please meet me in the middle!

### a little background

I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome[^1], now called Autistic Spectrum Condition[^2], at the age of 29.
I have been autistic all my life and always will be.
This is because autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects the way my brain processes information.

[^1]: this name is now considered problematic for a number of [valid reasons](https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13229-018-0208-6). I don't mind it being used to describe me, but out of respect for the wider autism community I tend to simply describe myself as _autistic_.

[^2]: this term is preferred by many autistic people in lieu of the accepted medical name _Autism Spectrum Disorder_.

You might have heard autism described as a ''spectrum''.
This is because no two autistic people are the same.
There are many things we have in common -- the traits that make us autistic -- but we all experience these in different ways, in different combinations, and to different degrees of intensity.
The things I'm sharing here describe my specific experience of autism.

Being autistic has caused me many challenges, and continues to do so, but there are also many things I like about being autistic.
For example, I am good at abstract reasoning; I come up with unconventional solutions to problems; I quickly notice patterns and can quickly grasp how things work; I give my interests unrelenting focus; and I thrive on collecting information and understanding things.

### but you don't seem autistic

So I have been told. And so have many other autistic people.
This is because of [masking](https://www.tiimoapp.com/blog/masters-of-masking-autistic-men-who-camouflage/).
In brief, we consciously suppress behaviours that come naturally to us (such as stimming and infodumping), and adopt behaviours that don't come naturally (such as sustaining eye contact or making small talk).
We do this to better fit into the neurotypical world.
After a lifetime of masking to survive, many of us become very good at it.
This is why I, and many other autistic people, often do not seem autistic.

It might seem like a compliment to tell us this, but it can be invalidating to hear.
And the implication that there's something desirable about seeming less autistic is hurtful: it suggests that there's something fundamentally _wrong_ with who we are.

Masking comes at a cost: it demands constant vigilance.
At best this is exhausting, and at worst can lead to shutdown and burnout.
It's a little like living in a country where nobody speaks your native language.
To communicate and survive, you must learn and use the local language, which requires constant attention and effort.
Even after many years, you'll probably always speak with an accent and misunderstand idioms.
A few hours at a party, for a native speaker, might be a relaxing way to unwind, but by the end of the night you will probably be exhausted from the effort of _simply communicating_.
<span class="example">Note: this doesn't mean you can't enjoy the party!</span>


### communication

Autism means I communicate differently from [allistic](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/allistic)[^3] people.
Masking means I make an effort to suppress many of these differences, but I can't do this _all_ the time.
And even when I do mask, there are things I can't change.
Being aware of these points can help us communicate better:

[^3]: a word adopted by the autism community to describe someone who is not autistic. This is a distinct term from ''neurotypical'', which describes someone not affected by the many conditions collectively referred to as [neurodivergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity).

        <p class="example">
            A manager at a previous job said something along the lines of, ''this really needs doing''. I told him, ''okay,'' and we left it at that. A couple of days later he asked me ''have you done [the thing]?'' and I, surprised, responded, ''no, you didn't ask me to!''

            In retrospect, it's clear to me what he wanted — I can absolutely understand implicit and subtextual communication when given time to process.

            Once I know how you feel, I can be very empathetic, but I need some help getting there.
            I can often sense that something is wrong, but not understand what or why.
            In these situations, even if it's nothing to do with me it can be helpful to let me know, as otherwise I will be stuck trying to consciously figure out whether it's because of me.
            Counterintuitively, I can be very sarcastic myself, but can't always pick up when others are.

                Similarly, if I ask you a question, there's unlikely to be subtext — I probably just want a direct answer.

            A former colleague asked me — ''what are your lunch plans?'' — to which I responded with my lunch plans and returned to work.

            As it happened, I did want to get lunch together, and all was well.

            As, in the moment, I am often not able to infer the true intent of a question, the easiest way to avoid this situation is to ask directly for the information you need.

                I form social connections by exchanging information, rather than by making chit-chat or sharing emotions.
                Chances are, if I'm sharing info about something it's because I'm trying to engage with you, not because I'm trying to imply you don't understand.

            Linguistics, phonology, and language genealogy have been recurring <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/obsessions/all-audiences">special interests</a> of mine. 
            In a group conversation, someone who had recently relocated to a new country mentioned an interesting feature of the country's language.
            I happened to know a little bit about analogues of this feature in a number of other languages and so I thought the group would like to know a little about it.
            I shared what I had learnt and gave a number of examples, but nobody really engaged.
            The conversation quickly moved on and from that point onwards people were unresponsive to my contributions.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            In retrospect, this is because they were connecting over the person's <em>experience</em> and not the factual content.
            Whilst my contribution was well intentioned — I simply wanted to join in — it was received more like an unwelcome lecture than an attempt to connect.
            A little more understanding from both sides of our different communication styles would have avoided them feeling condescended and spoken down to, and avoided me feeling excluded and unwelcome.

                This is a very common autistic trait.
                I manage to hold back a lot of the time but I'm not always aware I'm doing it.
                If you're not interested, please interrupt and just say.
                It's much better than you being bored and me feeling humiliated after realising I've subjected you to an unwanted monologue!

        <h5>example</h5>
        <p class="example">
            At a pub with a group of friends, someone asked me what I had been up to recently. I mentioned that I was working on AI and audio synthesis, and they said, ''oh that sounds interesting.''
            I mistakenly took this as an invitation to explain more, and before I knew it I was in the middle of a big infodump.
            As I was speaking, I was having a great time. Infodumping feels fantastic, and I was completely oblivious to my friend's disinterest.
            But as I was wrapping up, another friend walked over and said, ''what's up, guys?'' to which the recipient of my infodump replied, ''Ben's just giving me a lecture.''
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            This is a pretty benign example — this is a friend who has known me long enough to accept this aspect of my personality.
            Even so, I was humiliated and he was bored. We could both have had a much better time if we'd simply had a mutual understanding that it was okay for him to let me know he was disinterested.

### executive functioning and sensory processing

Lots of evidence (see [here](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00276.x), [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-8106-5_8), [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-015-0689-1), [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361309103794), and [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361306066564)) shows that autistic brains work *differently* in a couple of key areas.
In particular, we can struggle with executive functioning and sensory processing.

            <p>
                Autism shares many characteristics with ADHD, one of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_dysfunction">executive dysfunction</a>.
                I can find it hard to plan, initiate, and switch tasks, and this often means I can't simply ''do'' things in the same way neurotypical people can.
                Please be patient!
            </p>

            <b>Feel free to remind me of the big picture.</b>
            <p>
                Autism means I can become very focused on details.
            </p>
        </summary>
            <p>
                This can be incredibly useful, but it can also mean I lose sight of the big picture.
                Sometimes this is fine, but sometimes this causes a problem, especially when collaborating.
                If you think I've gotten lost in the details, it's okay to let me know.
            </p>

        <h5>example</h5>
        <p class="example">
            Back in my days as a music producer, I met with another producer for a collaborative session.
            At some point he said, ''it would be cool if the sound could <em>morph</em> in to this other one.''
            I thought that sounded like a great idea, and an interesting challenge.
            I opened up <a href="https://cycling74.com/">Max/MSP</a> and started to put together a frequency-domain morphing algorithm.
            It proved to be a much bigger task than I had anticipated (how naïve I was) and I quickly became consumed by solving this problem, completely forgetting about the music we were making together.
            After an hour had passed, my collaborator excused himself and left.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            Of course, in hindsight this makes me cringe.
            Clearly this wasn't the best use of our time, and clearly it's not entirely socially appropriate to ignore someone whilst fixating on a tangential task they have little interest in. 
            But, this sort of thing happens frequently, and can be avoided by a little reminder to remember the big picture.

            </p>
        </summary>
            <p>
                From the outside this can look a little like obsession, but for me it's usually a good thing.
                It is often when I do things I'm proud of.
                Unless there's a good reason not to, it's probably best to leave me to it!

        </summary>
            <p>
                This is because autistic brains tend to struggle to ''filter'' sensory input.
                For me, this is particularly challenging with sound.
                Quiet sounds are hugely distracting and loud sounds can be very distressing -- the sound of a door slamming or a plate smashing can ruin the rest of my day.
                Particular types of sound can also lead to surprisingly strong emotional responses, which might not make total sense from an outside perspective.
                Of course, sounds happen, and I'm not asking anyone to be silent around me, but keeping in mind that this affects me will help us have a better time around each other.

            <p>
                I flick my fingers, twist my arms, bounce my legs, hyperextend my knuckles, roll my shoulders, balance objects, and line things up.
                When I'm alone this list is much longer. Lots of autistic people have a repertoire of these behaviours, called ''stims''.
                There are lots of theories as to why we do this, but ultimately they feel necessary and suppressing them is hard.

### the bucket

The world can be very intense for autistic people.
Sensory overload, social pressures, and unexpected change can all be very overwhelming.
To understand this I find it's helpful to imagine everyone as having a bucket.
Throughout the day, stressful experiences can add little bits of water to the bucket.
As the bucket fills up, it gets harder and harder to carry, and eventually becomes so heavy it may not even be possible to lift it.
Or the bucket might get so full it overflows.
Everyone has a bucket. Everyone's bucket is different. Some are big, some are small.
Some have big taps that open easily, whilst some have small taps that barely let the water escape.
Autistic people tend to have small buckets, and this alone is difficult.
But the big difference is that there are many things which don't add water to most people's buckets, but which **add water to ours.**

These points explain how my bucket gets filled up, and what happens when it gets too full:

            </p>
        </summary>
            <p>
                I like to socialise, but the truth is I need to recover from almost every social occasion.
                If I turn down an invitation, it's likely because I need to think about how much space remains in my bucket.

            </p>
        </summary>
            <p>
                Adapting to change is hard, and socialising with new people is hard.
                If you can let me know ahead of time, I can prepare myself and keep my bucket empty, which can make things easier.
                The more information you can give about what to expect, the better.
            </p>
    </details>

            </p>
        </summary>
            <p>
                Perhaps you've had a hard day and need to vent, or perhaps you want my input or opinion or something.
                If my bucket is already full, giving you the engagement you want may be more than I'm capable of.
                However, communicating this without being rude is a big challenge, and if I'm already drained I may not be able to put on the necessary social performance —
                it's hard for me to navigate the social nuances of politely asking someone to leave me alone!
                To avoid this tricky situation, you can directly ask whether I'm currently able to engage with you.

            <b>Understand shutdowns.</b>
            <p>
                <a href="https://autismwestmidlands.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meltdown_shutdown.pdf">Autistic shutdown</a> is, essentially, what happens when our buckets get too full to carry.
            </p>
        </summary>
            <p>
                For me this means I will likely have a very distant expression on my face, not be moving much, and be unlikely to talk.
                In this situation, I need a calm, quiet place to recover.
                Often I'm able to anticipate the shutdown and remove myself from the situation.
                Generally, if I seem blank, distant, or withdrawn, I probably need to empty my bucket, and simply need space. Don't take it personally!
                If you notice this happening, you can help me get away and avoid challenging sensory stimuli or social pressures.
                Don't pressure me to talk or do anything! I'll let you know when I'm ready to re-engage.
            </p>

        <h5>example</h5>
        <p class="example">
            A recent shutdown occurred because I had spent three consecutive days away from home in the company of other people.
            Whilst they were all lovely people and I enjoyed their company (when my bucket was less full), eventually the social demands and unfamiliarity of the situation took their toll and led to a shutdown.
            Thankfully, the full shutdown only started when I made it home, but it meant I was unable to do much other than lie down for several hours.
            My partner was able to help me by ensuring my environment was calm and taking care of obligations like making food.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            Shutdowns normally have a recovery period, during which I am particularly sensitive, and prone to having further shutdowns.
            Some of my other autistic traits may become more pronounced during this time, as I usually do not have the energy to effectively mask.
            This particular shutdown was no different, and I was forced to cancel a meeting and a social occasion the following day.

            <b>Rituals help me keep my bucket from filling up.</b>
            <p>
                You might notice that I need certain things to be done in a particular way.
            </p>
        </summary>
            <p>
                Similarly, there are certain objects I like to keep in a particular place, and certain things I'd prefer not to share.
                This predictability helps me deal with the unpredictable things in life.
                If it doesn't cause you any problems, we'll both have a better time if you just let me get on with it!
            </p>

        <h5>example</h5>
        <p class="example">
            I am an absolute nightmare to cook with for two reasons.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            Firstly, it is difficult for me to deviate from my learned way of doing things.
            You want to chop the onion differently to me? You organise your cooking space differently to me? That's going to be a struggle for me.
            If my bucket is relatively empty, I will probably suppress the urge to ask you to do it differently, but this act of masking will add to my bucket.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            Secondly, cooking alone is a soothing, ritualistic activity for me.
            Cooking <em>together</em> is chaotic, intense, and fraught with subtle social challenges that continually add to my bucket.
            Sooner or later, my bucket will get too full to mask and you might find me suddenly intense or difficult to be around.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            This is not to say I can't cook with people, or that it can't be enjoyable.
            When I've successfully cooked with other people, it has been because we agreed in advance who would take which tasks.
            This was done in such a way that allowed me to stick to my established ways of doing things, whilst others could do things as they wished.
